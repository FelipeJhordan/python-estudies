## Arithmetic operators in Python and JavaScript
## Floor division only exists in python
## Floor division return the integer quotient of the division between two numbers
# floorResult = 89 // 4
# print(floorResult) # 22

## Python allows you use multiplication on strings to repeat a pattern 
# "a" * 9

## Nonetheless not allow you sum number and string together (JS allows, because the number is auto cast in string)
# "a" + 9

## Python is no such thing as a decrement/increment operator 
## Like as
# let c = 2
# c = c++

## Difference Logical operators between js and python
# OPERATOR	PYTHON	JAVASCRIPT
# logical and	and	&&
# logical or	or	||
# logical negation	not	!

## Complex Data in js and python
